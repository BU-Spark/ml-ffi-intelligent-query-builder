## Introduction
This repository contains a software method to process natrual language (English preferred) into mongoDB queries. This project is mainly built for Vianey, Freedom for Immigrants project. Vianey is a database which stores information from various industries and clients in JSON and spreadsheet format. By following the pipeline provided in this file or following the API guide, one should be able to produce a logical mongoDB query by entering correct parameters.

A more accurate description can be found in the path [./project-structure/project-document.md](./project-structure/project-document.md).   
Dependencies can be found in ``requirments.txt``, or click [here](./requirements.txt).

## Installation Instuctions

To successfully run the pipeline. 
First, make sure you are using python version `â‰¥ python3.8.5`.    
Then, run:  
`<your python environment> -m pip install requirements.txt` <br>

> note: all other dependencies should be resolved in the Jupyter notebooks. 

Deployment.ipynb contains the entire program pipeline

## Project Structure

- /src/ : contains source code needed to run program (Deployment.ipynb), initial EDA, and the test database (cust_data.csv, driver_data.csv, order_data.csv, cust_service_data.csv)
- /Project Research/ : contains all preliminary research done for the project. 
- Deployment.ipynb : jupyter notebook that contains the entire pipeline
