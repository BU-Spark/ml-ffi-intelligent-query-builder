## Introduction
This repository contains a software method to process natrual language (English preferred) into mongoDB queries. This project is mainly built for Vianey, Freedom for Immigrants project. Vianey is a database which stores information from various industries and clients in JSON and spreadsheet format. By following the pipeline provided in this file or following the API guide, one should be able to produce a logical mongoDB query by entering correct parameters.

A more accurate description can be found in the path [./project-structure/project-document.md](./project-structure/project-document.md).   

Dependencies can be found in ``requirments.txt``, or click [here](./requirements.txt).

## Background
There are few previous research being done in the exact topic as what we are facing, which is converting natural language to NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, queries languages. However, there are existing projects that deals with natural language <==> SQL queries, which determines our route of solving this problem. 

More details could be found in our research file [here](./project-research/research.md)

## Use Instructions
>This section provides information on how to use or test the project.

### How to use the deployed solution

On [this link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/spark-ds549/DS_549_Spring2023_FFI_Project), you will find an input UI where you can insert your OpenAI personal key and organization key as well as the English query that you want converted. If you do not have an organization key, type "None" for that field. After pressing submit, the MongoDB query should be outputted on the right. 

OpenAI's free personal API keys only allow a fixed number of queries. We recommending joining BU Spark's organization on OpenAI as keys generated from there will have a far higher number of queries available.

#### How to get OpenAI Organization ID
You can change your organization in the user dropdown at the top right of the page.

Once you have switched to your organization,

### How to test the source file
[source file](src/Deployment.ipynb)

#### Prerequisite
python version `â‰¥ python3.8.5` installed

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) installed

[Optional] python [virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)

#### [Optional] Using virtual environment
create virtual environment

`python3 -m venv </path/to/new/virtual/environment>`  

Activate virtual env:   

`source </path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/activate`

Confirm python path:

`which python`

It should be in the </path/to/new/virtual/environment> directory:

`...</path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/python`

#### install dependencies 
[requirements](requirements.txt)

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>

> note: File is originally run on Google Colab, you might need to upload test data file located in the `src` folder.
To run them locally, you need to clone the repo and change file path in the source file according to your working directory.

### Project Structure:
- [src](src/) : contains the full project pipeline (Deployment.ipynb), EDA (EDA.ipynb), and the four csv files the we are using as a mock dataset (customer_data.csv, driver_data.csv, order_data.csv, cust_service_data.csv)
- [project-research](project-research/) : contains all preliminary research done in the early development stage. 
- [project-structure](project-structure/) : contains all preliminary research done in the early development stage. 

## Risks and Limitations
>This section identifies foreseeable harms and misunderstandings.

The entered content in the field "Plain Text Query" is passed as is to OpenAI SQL Translate API.

## Evaluation

[Proof_of_Concept](src/Proof_of_Concept.ipynb)

In the Proof of Concept, at the bottom you will see a few sample queries followed by what the computer returned for those queries. Under that, you will see the manually written expected queries. The computer creates a set of valid queries with two points to note. As pointed out in the Proof of Concept, one of the queries has a redundant statement that isn't inaccurate but just extraneous. Another point to note was that one should be careful when using words like "last year" or "this month" because the computer doesn't necessarily know the current time and date, as seen in the last query. 

## Potential Improvements
>This section provides information on potential improvements.

Continue with using OpenAI SQL translate:
1.  For better information security, obfuscate recognized entities with random nouns and pass it to API, then replace the nouns back in the returned SQL query. 

Or replace OpenAI API with custom model:
1. Use a Large Language Model, may encounter accuracy trade-off in translating SQL.
2. Train a model optimized for SQL translation.

### Future Integration
Containerize this project and deploy as an API for embedded performance.
