## Overview

>_A brief summary of the project based on initial research and stakeholder meetings. To the best of your abilities, 
explain at a high level the stakeholdersâ€™ desired outcome for the project as well as the potential business value or 
impact this project will have if successfully completed._

Vianey, our database, is used to collect and store information about abuses suffered in immigration detention, requests for support from folks in detention, case management, bond fund, and several other buckets of work. Because our organization stores aggregate data from many different programs, we are often asked to run queries/pull data from a variety of different staff and partners. This is incredibly important, as it is used for various reports and campaigns, but it is very time consuming for staff. We would like for BU Spark! to design a query builder that will intake requests in plain language, turn them into logical queries, and pull the data. 

1. Situation and current issues
2. Key Questions
    1. What language is the NL(natural language) text written in?
    2. Will the database schema change overtime?
    3. Does the future user of this product know the exact entity names in the database?
    4. Will the future user try to use the exact entity names to build the query text?
    5. How much data is provided?
    6. **I think we need more ideas here!**
3. Hypothesis: Overview of how it could be done
4. Impact -- need further communication with the client

### A. Problem Statement: 

Vianey is a database which stores information from various industries and clients in JSON and spreadsheet format. We want to achieve the function that given a piece of plain text of human natural language, we shall generate a logical query that would obtain the data from Vianey database as desired.

### B. Checklist for project completion

>_Provide a bulleted list of the concrete deliverables and artifacts that, when complete, define the completion of the
 project._

1. A model that is able to identify the entities in a plain text request and their relationship to each other. 
2. A method to map the outputs from deliverable 1 to an executable query on MongoDB.


### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI. 

>_To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to 
automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible._

Human procedures:
1. given a prompt of text.
2. identify the terms in the text.
3. identify the relationship between the terms and the database schemas. i.e. identify the table relevent to the text query.
4. construct the logical query.
5. execute the query and examine the result.
6. 

### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

Operationlization is as important as the query tool we to build. This is because any technology is useless if people are unable to use it. There are several possible ways of operationalize the tool. 
1. Creating a basic terminal interface that allows people to obtain data and generate output files would be sufficient for staff who have tech backgrounds; adding on to this, we could also containerize the tool into a Docker image for easier deployments. 
2. We can deploy the tool in to a server, and create a web app which links to the database. By running the data query tool as a serverless function call, we are able to return and display the data on the web page for beter user experience. This solution will help more staff who does not have sufficient technical background to use this tool.
