## Overview

_A brief summary of the project based on initial research and stakeholder meetings. To the best of your abilities, 
explain at a high level the stakeholders’ desired outcome for the project as well as the potential business value or 
impact this project will have if successfully completed._



1. Situation and current issues
2. Key Questions
    1. What language is the NL(natural language) text written in?
    2. Will the database schema change overtime?
4. Hypothesis: Overview of how it could be done
5. Impact


### A. Problem Statement: 

_In as direct terms as possible, provide the “Data Science” problem statement version of the overview. Think of this as 
translating the above into a more technical definition to execute on._

Given a text of human natural language and a database, generate the query that would obtain the information the text wants from the database.


### B. Checklist for project completion

_Provide a bulleted list of the concrete deliverables and artifacts that, when complete, define the completion of the
 project._



1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2


### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI. 

_To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to 
automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible._


### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

_Data Science Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool
 produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or proof of concept. If possible, be specific and
 call out the relevant technologies_
